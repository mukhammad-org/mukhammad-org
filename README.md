IT | Systems | Continuous Improvement








I’m interested in how infrastructure works behind the scenes — operating systems, networks, and support processes.
I use GitHub to:
Practice what I learn
Break problems down
Improve step by step
My goal is simple: become technically strong through discipline and consistency.
